## 🏆 My FLL Competition Experience

I had the privilege of participating in the **FIRST LEGO League (FLL)** competitions during **5th and 6th grade** in elementary school, and again in **1st and 2nd grade** in middle school. While the challenges were tough, these experiences were incredibly rewarding and taught me valuable skills.

### 🔹 What I Learned
- **Problem-solving through science projects**: I identified real-world problems and devised solutions by working through scientific processes.
- **Robot coding and debugging**:
  - Logged and analyzed data to identify and resolve issues.
  - Used a **gyro sensor** to correct the robot's navigation and improve its accuracy.
  - Explored **PID control** to fine-tune robot movements, gaining a foundational understanding of advanced control systems.
- **Practical applications of math**:
  - Learned coordinate programming and its practical use before encountering trigonometry in school, which made later studies more intuitive.

### 🔹 Key Takeaway
These experiences taught me to approach concepts by understanding their practical uses first. By learning **how** and **why** to apply these principles, I developed a deeper understanding and appreciation for science and technology. The FLL competitions also fostered my curiosity and passion for **robotics and problem-solving**.
