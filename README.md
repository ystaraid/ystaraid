## 🏆 Achievements & Experiences

### 🔹 Engineering Competitions
1. **School Engineering Competitions**:
   - 🏅 **5th Grade on Elementary School**: 1st Place in the School Mechanical Engineering Contest.
   - 🏅 **6th Grade on Elementary School**: 1st Place in the School Mechanical Engineering Contest.
   - 🏅 **1st Grade on Middle School**: 1st Place in the School Mechanical Engineering Contest.

2. **Regional Competitions**:
   - 📌 Represented my school at the **Local Office of Education Mechanical Engineering Competition** for three consecutive years. These opportunities challenged me to refine my designs, optimize robot performance, and apply creative solutions to real-world scenarios.

   In these competitions, I designed and built robots using **ScienceBox**, a robotics kit that emphasizes mechanical engineering concepts. Through this, I learned how to:
   - ⚙️ Adjust **gear ratios** to control motor power and achieve precise movements.
   - 🛠️ Perform tasks using **mechanisms without external power**, relying purely on mechanical structures.
   - 🛞 Choose the **right type of wheels** for various terrains and challenges.
   - 🔗 Build and utilize **universal joints** to transfer motion effectively between different axes.
   - 🌀 Solve problems by using elastic materials like **rubber bands** to store and release energy.
