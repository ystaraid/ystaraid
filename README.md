## 🏆 Achievements & Experiences

### 🔹 Engineering Competitions
1. **School Engineering Competitions**:
   - 🏅 **5th Grade on Elementary School**: 1st Place in the School Mechanical Engineering Contest.
   - 🏅 **6th Grade on Elementary School**: 1st Place in the School Mechanical Engineering Contest.
   - 🏅 **1st Grade on Middle School**: 1st Place in the School Mechanical Engineering Contest.

2. **Regional Competitions**:
   - 📌 Represented my school at the **Local Office of Education Mechanical Engineering Competition** for three consecutive years. These opportunities challenged me to refine my designs, optimize robot performance, and apply creative solutions to real-world scenarios.

   In these competitions, I designed and built robots using **ScienceBox**, a robotics kit that emphasizes mechanical engineering concepts. Through this, I learned how to:
   - ⚙️ Adjust **gear ratios** to control motor power and achieve precise movements.
   - 🛠️ Perform tasks using **mechanisms without external power**, relying purely on mechanical structures.
   - 🛞 Choose the **right type of wheels** for various terrains and challenges.
   - 🔗 Build and utilize **universal joints** to transfer motion effectively between different axes.
   - 🌀 Solve problems by using elastic materials like **rubber bands** to store and release energy.

## 🏆 My FLL Competition Experience

I had the privilege of participating in the **FIRST LEGO League (FLL)** competitions during **5th and 6th grade** in elementary school, and again in **1st and 2nd grade** in middle school. While the challenges were tough, these experiences were incredibly rewarding and taught me valuable skills.

### 🔹 What I Learned
- **Problem-solving through science projects**: I identified real-world problems and devised solutions by working through scientific processes.
- **Robot coding and debugging**:
  - Logged and analyzed data to identify and resolve issues.
  - Used a **gyro sensor** to correct the robot's navigation and improve its accuracy.
  - Explored **PID control** to fine-tune robot movements, gaining a foundational understanding of advanced control systems.
- **Practical applications of math**:
  - Learned coordinate programming and its practical use before encountering trigonometry in school, which made later studies more intuitive.

### 🔹 Key Takeaway
These experiences taught me to approach concepts by understanding their practical uses first. By learning **how** and **why** to apply these principles, I developed a deeper understanding and appreciation for science and technology. The FLL competitions also fostered my curiosity and passion for **robotics and problem-solving**.
